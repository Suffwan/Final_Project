 # SQL analysis for Toronto Raptors Vs Golden State Warriors 

 * I have done few numbers of analysis to get insights from the dataset for Match against Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors.

 * This is the analysis to find, 'How many games Toronto Raptors won and lose in thier carrier'?
   ```sql
   SELECT
    team_name_home AS team_name,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN wl_home = 'W' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS games_won,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN wl_home = 'L' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS games_lost
FROM final_project.`game`
WHERE team_name_home = 'Toronto Raptors'
GROUP BY team_name_home;


 * This SQL code is to find Raptors performance for playing in Home and Away by calculating Avg points 
      ```sql
      SELECT
    team_name_home,
    AVG(pts_home) AS avg_home_points,
    AVG(pts_away) AS avg_away_points
FROM final_project.game
WHERE team_name_home = 'Toronto Raptors' 
GROUP BY team_name_home;


  * This SQL code is to find Golden State Warriors performance for playing in Home and Away by calculating Avg points 
      ```sql
      SELECT
    team_name_home,
    AVG(pts_home) AS avg_home_points,
    AVG(pts_away) AS avg_away_points
FROM final_project.game
WHERE team_name_home = 'Golden State Warriors' 
GROUP BY team_name_home;

    COUNT(CASE WHEN wl_home = 'W' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS games_won,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN wl_home = 'L' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS games_lost
FROM final_project.`game`

GROUP BY team_name_home;

  * This is the analysis to find, 'Toronto raptors Playing from Home vs Golden State Warriors Playing away and the winner for those matches'?
    ```sql
    SELECT
    g.game_date,
    g.team_name_home AS home_team,
    g.team_name_away AS away_team,
    gi.attendance,
    CASE
        WHEN g.pts_home > g.pts_away THEN g.team_name_home
        WHEN g.pts_home < g.pts_away THEN g.team_name_away
        ELSE 'Tie'
    END AS winner
FROM final_project.`game` g
JOIN final_project.`game_info` gi ON g.game_id = gi.game_id
WHERE g.game_date >= '2019-01-01' AND g.game_date <= '2019-12-31'
    AND (
        (g.team_name_home = 'Toronto Raptors' AND g.team_name_away = 'Golden State Warriors')
        );
