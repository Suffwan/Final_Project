  ## This project is an Analysis on NBA dataset 

* I took the NBA dataset from Kaggle.
* There were many tables given in that dataset but i selected only two tables for my analysis.
* In that dataset I selected two tables one is fact table and one is dimenssion table, My fact table is contain (games) table and my dimenssion table contain (game_info) table. 
* For the analysis on my dataset i perform all the analysis on MySQL. For the analysis I tried to do it in a way where I did the analysis on my two favoirte teams 
  ('Toronto Raptors vs Golden State Warriors'). 
* I tried to perfome some analysis on it to get some results. 
* Other approch i did for analysis is that I perform the analysis on all the teams and tried to get as much insights as I can from Dataset.
